## Installation

### Using Poetry (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TarunVedula/python-substack.git
cd python-substack

# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Activate the virtual environment
poetry shell
```

### Using pip

```bash
pip install python-substack
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Set up Authentication

Create a `.env` file in your project directory:

```env
SUBSTACK_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
SUBSTACK_PASSWORD=your-password
```

### 2. Basic Usage

```python
from substack import SubstackAPI
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Initialize the API client
api = SubstackAPI(
    email=os.getenv("SUBSTACK_EMAIL"),
    password=os.getenv("SUBSTACK_PASSWORD")
)

# Get subscriber count
subscriber_count = api.get_subscriber_count()
print(f"Current subscribers: {subscriber_count}")

# Create a new post
post_data = {
    "title": "My First API Post",
    "subtitle": "Created using python-substack",
    "body": "This post was created programmatically using the python-substack library!",
    "published": True
}

post = api.create_post(post_data)
print(f"Post created: {post.title}")
```

## Examples

### Publishing a Post

```python
from substack import SubstackAPI

api = SubstackAPI(email="your-email@example.com", password="your-password")

post_data = {
    "title": "Hello World",
    "subtitle": "A test post",
    "body": "# Hello World\n\nThis is a test post created with python-substack.",
    "published": True
}

post = api.create_post(post_data)
print(f"Published: {post.url}")
```

### Creating a Draft

```python
post_data = {
    "title": "Draft Post",
    "subtitle": "This is a draft",
    "body": "This post is saved as a draft.",
    "published": False
}

draft = api.create_post(post_data)
print(f"Draft created: {draft.id}")
```

### Getting Subscriber Count

```python
subscriber_count = api.get_subscriber_count()
print(f"You have {subscriber_count} subscribers")
```

### Uploading Images

```python
# Upload an image
image_url = api.upload_image("path/to/image.jpg")

# Use the image in a post
post_data = {
    "title": "Post with Image",
    "body": f"Here's an image: ![Image]({image_url})",
    "published": True
}

post = api.create_post(post_data)
```
